Besides, by the year of 1926, the regime so-called §YMilitary Government of China§! which occupied western China was defeated by §BGuangzhou National Government§! and the remnants of its defeated troops, §YXibei Jingguo Army§! led by Feng Yuxiang entered this region as uninvited guest. The ruling Ma'ahun family failed in expelling Feng's troops and acquiesced in Feng's rights to participate this wargaming. But the warlordism_subtype prevents us from being invaded by foreign countries because there's even no an authority who's able response to any ultimatum."

 POLITICS_MA_BUFANG_DESC:0 "归义军§Y节度使§!\n和朝西北军§Y总司令§!\n\n胡塞尼·马阿訇，为害河湟地区十余年的屠夫，如今正稳坐归义军节度使的江山。\n\n归义军境内回、汉、藏、蒙民族互相杂居，目不识丁的贫困蒙人、汉人也经常逃到这片§O贫瘠而辽阔的大地§!上，时间久了，他们便忘记了祖先的姓名。在大东帝国的人口普查中，许多人干脆就把自己父辈或祖辈的诨名、职业或小名当作姓名，于是“尔撒·白掌柜的”“雅斯尔·十娃子”“伊斯马尔·沈老三”这样令人哭笑不得的姓氏便出现了。\n\n胡塞尼的姓氏就来自于他的祖先中十分出名的一位阿訇——§Y马·阿卜都里则孜§!或“马海宴”，他曾率领族人起兵反对和朝统治，但最终归降于大东帝国朝廷，还成为了新一任归义军节度使。1924年，困居中国西北地区的工农红军派出西路军向归义军节度使的辖区进军，他们认为长期受到马家军压迫的河湟百姓会揭竿而起，西路军将以摧枯拉朽之势击垮敌军。\n\n西路军的初期进军确实非常顺利，但是好大喜功的张国焘强令西路军在补给未能抵达的情况下进行急行军。当士兵们疲惫不堪之时，年轻的胡塞尼率领他的部下对西路军展开了一场§R大屠杀§!——没错，这场“战斗”只有杀戮，投降的西路军士兵被他残忍杀害，女兵遭到强奸，少数幸存者也几乎被贩卖为奴。\n\n胡塞尼·马阿訇肆意压迫节度使辖区内的老百姓，强征壮丁、掠人妻女，自称“生我、我生者外无不奸”，属下与家族成员的女性都难逃他的魔爪。马阿訇家族中唯一反对他的是§R尕司令·马阿訇§!，然而这位年少的杀人魔王仅仅因为前者褫夺了他的权力而意图反抗，而不包含任何的良心动机。现在唯一能压制他的便是叔父穆斯塔法，然而当两人的关系最终破裂，归义军节度使内部再次爆发混战，受尽压迫的民众也许还能看到一线生机......"
 POLITICS_MA_LIN_DESC:0 "青海、甘肃、宁夏省§Y主席§!\n\n" 
 POLITICS_MA_ZHONGYING_DESC:0 "河西省行政委员会§Y主席§!\n甘宁青联军§Y总司令§!\n\n尕司令的意思是“娃娃司令”，尕司令·马阿訇算得上是一位少年英雄，可惜他只是另一个杀人魔王罢了。\n\n1928年，遭到国民革命军西北野战军追击的§Y冯玉祥§!不得已退入宁夏地区，他率领的§Y西北靖国军§!已是困顿不堪。几名士兵违背军令，公开打家劫舍。那时还叫巴特尔·马阿訇的尕司令率6名好友袭击一队靖国军运输队，缴获大批武器。随后他召集当地两三万民众建立武装，自封为司令，从此他便被老百姓尊称为“尕司令”。\n\n尕司令率领部队在河湟地区大闹一番，无数生灵涂炭。他很快就成为瓜分归义军节度使权力的一份子，然而他始终和节度使胡塞尼存在矛盾，原因也很简单，胡塞尼绝不愿意将自己的利益让出半点给尕司令这个“外人”，这让尕司令极为恼怒。此后尕司令便开始筹划着推翻胡塞尼的统治，甚至不惜与准噶尔汗国残部进行交易。\n\n如今随着胡塞尼和穆斯塔法在内战中伤亡惨重，尕司令感到有机可乘，他的蒙古盟友也应允提供了军队，只要尕司令愿意割让一小块土地给他们。当尕司令的部队迈入兰州大门，他将借助更加恐怖的武力巩固自己的统治，因为尕司令有一个疯狂的梦想，那便是以河西走廊为根据地，向西征服整个内亚地区，从而建立一个伊斯兰教的大突厥斯坦......"
 POLITICS_XIDAOTANG_DESC:0 "1903年，扎吉德·马阿訇改名为§Y马启西§!，脱离北庄门宦后于甘肃临潭创建了金星堂，1909年正式定名§R西道堂§!。这一宗教组织因其以刘智等人汉文著译为传教依据，又称汉学派。西道堂在教义上以刘智的学说为依据，坚持正统信仰，履行五功，简化宗教仪式，重视文化教育；教权结构实行教主集权制。教主的言行对教徒有约束力，任职终身，但不世袭。西道堂创始人马启西劝导教下群众，合伙经商务农，开发洮水上游草荒之地，部分教下率先将其财产的全部或一半归入道堂，开始过集体生活。西道堂深受马阿訇家族的压迫，其创始人马启西就是被胡塞尼·马阿訇借故杀害，然而随着归义军节度使的彻底覆灭，西道堂终于有机会在这片大地上推行自己的§R宗教共产主义§!理想，人共联的同志也在赞赏他们的伟大构想与努力。"
 POLITICS_XI_ZHONGXUN_DESC:0 "归义军节度使的刽子手们认为西路军已经彻底灭亡了，然而事实证明他们完全想错了，西路军的少数残兵确实躲藏了起来，而保护他们的正是这些高高在上的军阀们最看不起的老百姓。习仲勋便是其中一员，当马阿訇的士兵挨家挨户搜寻残兵时，曾受过西路军帮助的回族老百姓设法把他隐匿了下来。为了掩人耳目，方便公开活动，习仲勋依照自己父亲的职业给自己取了一个非常“归义军”的名字——§Y麦吉德·习掌柜的§!，他凭借从父亲继承下来的手艺开了一家小店铺，继续设法与中国这边取得联系。黄河对岸的密使划着皮筏子，带着无线电台和军火来到这片荒凉的土地，“习掌柜的”很快建立起了一支小规模的游击队，但是他没有能力推翻归义军的统治，只能在军阀的势力边缘苟延残喘。如今随着军阀内战爆发，“习掌柜的”成功组织了一场暴动，控制了兰州城及周边地区，国民革命军的支援部队抵达黄河岸边，归义军势力顷刻间瓦解。终于河湟地区得到了解放，而“习掌柜的”不再讳言自己的理想：他要让河湟地区在中国和东亚文明之国的协助下，成为美丽富饶的新世界。"
